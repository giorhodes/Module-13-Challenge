    Hi, I'm Ade. I'm a Front End Developer based in London with a passion for web development. In my 1 year of experience, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and have developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, photography, and trying new restaurants.
